TACCGGAT-TACCGGAT has a very high proportion of reads, this could be due to overrepresentation of this sample in the pool. Unless this was intentional but without further clarification from the people wanting to run this I wouldn't know. In most cases though the reads should be fairly even across samples since most pools are made equimolar.
